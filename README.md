# FarmLinkIQ
Big Data for Homegrown, Local Food and Livestock Market Matching.

## FarmLinkIQ Prototype

This is a prototype for **FarmLinkIQ**, a data-driven platform designed to help small and local food producers make smarter, more sustainable decisions using public agricultural data.

The prototype features two key tools:
1. **Local Food Market Heatmap**  
   Visualizes farmers market density across the U.S. using USDA geospatial data.

2. **Food Waste Estimator**  
   Allows farmers to estimate spoilage, environmental impact, and potential financial loss based on produce type and quantity.

## Project Purpose

This project was developed as part of the MSBA 680: Big Data & Innovation course at the University of Montana.  
It demonstrates how open data + simple AI logic can deliver **real-world insights** for food system innovation and sustainability.
